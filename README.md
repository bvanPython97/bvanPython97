- 👋 Hi, I’m Bao Van
- 👀 I’m interested in working with data such as wrangling, exploring and building models. I love Python, and R. They both are very useful and powerful language in my opinion! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning and NLP through online courses. My major at school is MS. Applied Statistics at Loyola University Chicago.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with data!
